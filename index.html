		<h2>How to use wallpapers on your phone:</h2>

		<p>Copy or download the wallpapers to your device, unzip them and install using the stock android or apple operating system or use a third party Launcher like Nova Launcher to install the desired wallpaper to your home screen or lock screen.</p>


		<br />
		<br />

		
		<h2>A longer explanation for how to use the wallpaper images:</h2>


			<p>You can add the wallpapers in several ways:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Most commonly use the phones stock operating system to change the look and theme of the device. To do this, press and hold the home screen for a few seconds, tap 'Wallpaper & style', select 'Change wallpaper' and then select which source to get the wallpaper image from. Tap the little tick mark on the image you want, press done then choose where to apply (Lock screen, Home screen or both) then press done to set.</li>

			<li>You can also use a third-party launcher like Nova Launcher or Apex Launcher which work in a similar way but may also allow for additional settings to set dynamic wallpapers, adjust positioning or size the wallpaper differently etc. Launchers can also be used to change all sorts of things about the phones appearance from changing the icons to tweaking every aspect of your phone's interface, layout and animations. They can replace the default home screen and app drawer of a mobile device and allow users to endlessly customize the look and feel of their device's interface. See below to use them for setting the wallpaper.</li>

			<li>Changing your wallpaper with Nova Launcher and Action Launcher - 1. Press and hold the home screen.
2. Choose the Wallpapers option. 3. Select one from the collections of wallpapers included with your phone, or from third-party applications. 4. Tap Set wallpaper on the upper left corner of your screen. 5. Choose whether you want to set the wallpaper for your home screen, lock screen, or both.</li>

			<li>The wallpapers may look slightly different than they do in the example above depending on the aspect ratio of your device but the phone should automatically scale or cut off the wallpapers to best fit (if it doesn't you can just compare them to stock wallpapers on your phone and use a graphics program to change the sizes to match.</li>


		</ol>


		<br />
		<br />


		<h2>Some general notes about these wallpapers:</h2>

		<ul>

			<li>These wallpapers were gathered together to try to replicate those on a stock galaxy S4 however different regions and customised or branded user interfaces may have had different wallpapers.</li>

			<li>These wallpapers can best be used in conjunction with 'galaxy-s4-icon-pack' which you can find here: <a href="https://boxbot6.github.io/galaxy-s4-icon-pack/">https://boxbot6.github.io/galaxy-s4-icon-pack</a> together with an explanation of how to use it.</li>

			<li>The wallpapers contained in this pack are basically just .jpg and .png images so you can resize and adjust them as you wish.</li>

			<li>The wallpapers included in this pack are of various sizes but mostly 1920 x 1920 pixels in .jpg format which appears to be a common standard for this era of phone, if you wanted to rescale them all to match newer phones, devices or tablets feel free, but but please note they may not then scale down properly again to work seemlessly on older phones.</li>

			<li>This wallpaper collection is provided 'as is' for information only.</li>
